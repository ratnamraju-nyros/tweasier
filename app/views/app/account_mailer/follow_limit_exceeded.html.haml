%h2= "Hi there #{@account.username}"

%p
  This email has been sent because your account
  = "(#{@account.username})"
  has exceeded the following limit imposed by Twitter. Don't panic, everything is OK!
%p As a precaution we have disabled our bulk follow tool to give you the chance to balance the level of the existing people you follow to an acceptable level. It is usually best if more people follow you than you follow or 1:1. Alternatively, you could simply wait a few days to give time for the other users to follow you back.
%p
  For more information about this matter please contact us or view
  = link_to "Twitters helpful guide", "http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/68916"
  on following best practices.
  %p
    For reference, you currently have
    %strong= @twitter_account.friends_count
    friends and are following
    %strong= @twitter_account.followers_count
    people.
    %p
      If you wish to turn the follower tool back on, or want to prune some of your existing followers generated by Tweasier using our unfollow tool, you can do so from the
      = link_to "account preferences", edit_app_user_account_url(@account)
      section of your account.
%p Happy twittering.
