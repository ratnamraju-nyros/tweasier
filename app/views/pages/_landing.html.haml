%h3 Finding people to follow on Twitter has never been so simple
%br
%p Using Tweasier you can tap into the power of Twitter by creating searches which find relevant local users to you. Once you've followed your users, many of them will follow you back because they have an interest in what you will be tweeting - it's that simple. We help you to find and engage with the most relevant users.
